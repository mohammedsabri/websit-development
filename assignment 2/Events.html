<h1> Create Youth SIDE</h1>
<h2></p>The main aim of 'Create YOUth SIDE! In Solidarity for Inclusion, Diversity and Equality project is to promote inclusive youth work practice in Europe through human rights education and creativity.
 We trust that youth work is about enabling younger generation to develop their voices and influences in today's society. 
 We also believe in the power of human rights education. 
 With populist and nationalist forces making significant gains in democratic states in recent years we feel that now, more than ever before, we need to work on developing human rights culture. 
 As youth work practitioners we have a responsibility to work towards building more peaceful word.
 Therefore all youth work practices should aim to be as inclusive as possible, supporting diversity and equal access of opportunities.
 Participatinf countries: Ireland, Italy, Georgia, Spain, Lithuania, Turkey and Romania </p>
